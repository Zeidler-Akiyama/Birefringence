# Birefringence
Python codes for birefringence calculation in biaxial materials

Both "birefringence_modules" and "birefringence_biaxial_2" are necessary to run the simulation.
While the modules-file contains all necessary functions, the parameter settings and plotting is performed in the biaxial-file.

## How to Perform a Simulation
The material under consideration is being defined via its indicatrix, that is the refractive index ellipsoid which is connected with the dielectric tensor $\epsilon$ via
