# Birefringence
Python codes for birefringence calculation in biaxial materials

Both "birefringence_modules" and "birefringence_biaxial_2" are necessary to run the simulation.
While the modules-file contain all necessary functions, the parameter settings and plotting is performed in the biaxial-file.
